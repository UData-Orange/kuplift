Example code
============

This directory contains examples of code to show how you can use this package.

Some of the examples may assume your current working directory is the toplevel of this package,
so as to be able to access the sample data files without the need to adapt their paths.

Here are three different ways to use the examples:

- Calling an example module using the python executable in "inspection" mode, for example:
  ~~~ console
  $ python -i .\examples\optimized_univariate_encoding.py
  ~~~

- Importing everything from this module in a running interpreter like this:
  ~~~ pycon
  >>> from examples.optimized_univariate_encoding import *
  ~~~
  
- Copying-pasting the code into a Python interpreter.
